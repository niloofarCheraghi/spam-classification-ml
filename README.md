Comparative study of ML models for spam email detection


# **Import necessary libraries**

**Project type:** Data Mining / Machine Learning - Spam Email Detection

## Summary
This repository contains a data mining project for spam email detection. The project trains and compares multiple machine learning models on a labeled dataset (spam vs ham). The main work is done in the Jupyter notebook `spamV2 (2).ipynb` included here.

## What you'll find
- `spamV2 (2).ipynb` — the main notebook with data loading, preprocessing (text cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF), model training, evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix), and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt` — suggested Python packages for reproducing the notebook environment.
- (Optional) `README.md` — this file.

## Suggested workflow to reproduce
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (venv or conda).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the notebook in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook.

## Possible models used
Common choices for this project are Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc. See the notebook for the exact models and hyperparameters used.
